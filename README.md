# sentence_word_search.py

This Python script checks if a specified word is included in a given sentence and counts how many times it appears. It provides a simple command-line interface where users can input a sentence and a word to search for within that sentence. The script handles case insensitivity by converting both the sentence and the word to lowercase before searching.

# Usage:

- Input a sentence.
- Input the word to search for within the sentence.
- Receive feedback on whether the word is included in the sentence and how many times it appears.

## Example:

```sh
Please insert a sentence: This is a test sentence to test the script
Please insert a word: test
The word 'test' is included in the sentence and it appears '2' times.
```

Feel free to clone or fork this repository to use the script for your own projects or contribute to its development.
